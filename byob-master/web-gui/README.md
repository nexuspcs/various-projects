BYOB is an open-source project that provides a framework for security researchers and developers 
to build and operate a basic botnet to deepen their understanding of the sophisticated malware 
that infects millions of devices every year and spawns modern botnets, in order to improve their 
ability to develop counter-measures against these threats. 

It is designed to allow developers to easily implement their own code and add cool new
features *without* having to write a **RAT** (Remote Administration Tool) or a
**C2** (Command & Control server) from scratch.

*The RAT's key feature is that arbitrary code/files can be remotely loaded into memory
from the C2 and executed on the target machine without writing anything to the disk.*

Supports Python 2 & 3.

*BYOB now includes a powerful web GUI which makes it more accessible to new users. Check out https://buildyourownbotnet.com to see a preview, or follow [this guide](https://github.com/malwaredllc/byob/wiki) to get started! Key features include:*

## Dashboard
A control panel for your C2 server with a point-and-click interface for executing post-exploitation modules across your botnet. The dashboard includes a map of your bots across the globe, and hashrate trackers & graphs for those of you mining Monero.

## Payload Generator
The payload generator uses black magic involving Docker containers & Wine servers to compile executable payloads for any platform/architecture you select.

## Terminal Emulator
The web app includes an in-browser terminal emulator so you can still have direct shell access even when using the GUI

### Donation

*By default BYOB will mine Monero in the background to support the developers. However, this can be disabled in the source code.*
